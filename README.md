# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Part 2: Advanced Computer Vision & Deep Learning

This repository will cover 7 topics:
- [Advanced CNN Architectures](\EvolutionOfR-CNN.ipynb)
- [YOLO](\YOLO.ipynb)
- [RNN's](\RNN.ipynb)
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
- Hyperparameters tuning
- Attention Mechanisms
- Image Captioning

Final Project will be to implement an effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder to predict captions for a given image. It can be found in this repository (link to be provided).
