# Advanced Computer Vision & Deep Learning

This repository has been created for documenting my progress during the second project of Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree: Image Captioning.<br>
Final Project will be to implement an effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder to predict captions for a given image.
