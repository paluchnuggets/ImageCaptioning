    "# LSTM for Part-of-Speech Tagging\n",
    "Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the category of word in accordance with its syntactic functions. So basically deciding wheter a word is a *noun*, *verb* etc.<br>In this notebook I will create simple LSTM model which will be able to determine wheter a word is a *noun*, *verb* or *adjective* in a given sentence.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we even need that?\n",
    "It can be used in various ways but the most popular and useful are:\n",
    "- Determinig on what subject is someone talking about\n",
    "- Creating artificial sentences\n",
    "- Understanding the context of a sentence (example: We have **major** advantage VS **major** Ted, report for duty\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preparing the Data\n",
    "\"The data\" in that case will be 4 sentences I wrote, so very small dataset but for the sake of example it is perfect. Train set is a list of 4 tuples, where each tuple has a following structure: `([\"word1\", \"word2\", \"word3\", ...],[\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", ...])` and tags are `DET, NN and V`"

Each word in our vocabulary will be presented as an vector of size `n`. Moreover each entry in a vector can be treated as a feature of the word, so due to that words(embedded vectors) can be compared using an angle between them as a measure of similarity (more about that [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html#word-embeddings-in-pytorch)).<br>\n",
