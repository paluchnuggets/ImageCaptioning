    "Reccurent neural networks' output depends not only on current input like in for example CNN, but also on states which emulates \"memory\". There are two main differences between RNN's and Feed Forward neural Networks(FFNN):<br>\n",
    "1. In RNN output of hidden layer becomes input to the network in the next training step.<br>\n",
    "2. In RNN, input is not a single example from dataset but a sequence.<br>\n",

    "Also **unfolded** version is useful to see more clearly how does \"memory\" component looks like.<br>\n",

    "Generally it can be seen that in RNN, output $\\bar{y}_t$ at time $t$ can be expressed as a function of previous inputs and weights: $\\bar{y}_t=F(\\bar{x}_{t},\\bar{x}_{t-1},\\bar{x}_{t-2},\\bar{x}_{t-3},,...,\\bar{x}_{t-t_{0}},W)$<br>\n",
